# event-espresso-addons

Working repo for EE addon development.
You could watch this repo shape up into something, but it would be like watching paint dry...

---
Add-on | Purpose
--- | ---
amta-chapter-tweaks | General plugin (not EE-related) for chapter sites. Anything that relates to plugins, as nothing it packaged with the theme.
eea-cert | Certificates add-on. Used to register legacy credits imported into a db table and credits entered into ticket details in EE. Creates certificates from the My Events page. Requires WP User integration to work correctly.
templates | Custom page section templates for the event editor and My Events pages. These live in the theme root folder when they're not hanging out here.
