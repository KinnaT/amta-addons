# event-espresso-addons

Repo for AMTA WordPress plugin development.

---
Add-on | Purpose
--- | ---
amta-chapter-tweaks | General plugin (not EE-related) for chapter sites. Anything that relates to plugins, as nothing is packaged with the theme.
eea-cert | Certificates add-on, built from scratch. Used to register legacy credits imported into a db table and credits entered into ticket details in EE. Creates certificates from the My Events page. Requires WP User integration to work correctly.
eea-wp-user-integration | Small changes to allow admins to register users from wp-admin and have the attendee/user link get created. Comments included.
templates | Custom page section templates for the event editor and My Events pages. These live in the theme root folder when they're not hanging out here. Overwrite the Event Espresso page template sections.
