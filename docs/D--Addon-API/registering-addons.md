# Registering Addons

Registering addons is a way of informing Event Espresso core addon exists and is a shortcut to adding hooks and filters.  This allows Event Espresso core to take care of much of the boilet-plate tasks like detecting plugin activation, upgrade, or reactivation; registering or de-registering components, and in the future many other tasks.

When developing an addon, it's best to start from the sample "New_Addon" contained in `event-espresso-core/tests/mocks/addons/new-addon`. This is a fully operating addon that is ready to be placed in your wp-content/plugins directory and used. It adds a sample admin page, widget, shortcode, model, data migration script, unit tests, etc. You can use the event-espresso-core/tests/utilities/renamer.php script to quickly rename the plugin according to your needs (it does an intelligent search-and-replace. Please refer to event-espresso-core/core/libraries/plugin_api/EE_Register_Addon.lib.php for the list of arguments you can supply to `EE_Register_Addon::register()`.
