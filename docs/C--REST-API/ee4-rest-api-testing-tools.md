# EE4 REST API: Testing Tools

Here are a few tools to help with testing the EE4 REST API:

* [WP API Basic Auth plugin](https://github.com/eventespresso/Basic-Auth) - Adds Basic Authentication to a WordPress site. Used for user authentication when testing private endpoints.
* [Postman extension for Google Chrome](https://www.getpostman.com/) - Great tool for sending POST requests and setting HTTP headers on those requests.
